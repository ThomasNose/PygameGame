Dumb 2D game made in python that I haven't really touched since 2018. 
The game is supposed to be a simulator of being late to a lecture and having to race to the university in a limited time to make it. 
The game will eventually have boss battles, obstacles, puzzles, items, collectables, character customisation etc etc. At the moment it's very rough.

Currently I plan to call this "late to lecture" which basically sums up the game entirely.
This current version is likely to be scrapped but offers a dumbed down sneak peak at what I hope to make it.
